1 What is a data class in Kotlin?

    ///////////////////////////////

1.This is a class dedicated solely to holding data. Once you add the keyword `data` before the code, Kotlin automatically creates background functions that save you from writing dozens of lines of code. These functions include:

`toString()`: To print the object's contents in a readable format (e.g., `Book(isbn=123, ...)`).

`equals()` & `hashCode()`: To compare two objects based on their data, not their memory location.

`copy()`: To create a new copy of the object with some modified values (this is where the power of `val` lies).

2 Why do we use val instead of var for the properties?

    ///////////////////////////

2.Using `val` (read-only) is standard practice (best practice) when defining data models for several reasons:

Immutability: It ensures that once an object is created, its data won't be accidentally altered elsewhere in the application. This makes the code "safe" and less prone to bugs.

3 What would happen if we used var instead?

       ////////////////////////// 

3.Technically, the code will work and Kotlin won't prevent you from doing so, but you will encounter the following problems:

Loss of control: Any part of the code can modify the book title or ISBN at any time, which could lead to unexpected results in databases or interfaces.

1 What is the purpose of the BookRepository class?



1️⃣ What is the role of BookRepository?
It is a class that manages book data.
It acts as an intermediary between the data source (here, a list) and the rest of the application.
👉 It follows the Repository Pattern to separate data logic from the UI.

2 What does the getAllBooks() function return?

2️⃣ What does getAllBooks() return?
fun getAllBooks(): List<Book>
It returns a list of books: List<Book>.


          //////////////////

3 How would you add a function to search books by title?

exemple:
fun searchBooksByTitle(query: String): List<Book> {
    return booksList.filter {
        it.title.contains(query, ignoreCase = true)
    }
}
This function returns all books whose title contains the searched text.
